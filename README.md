# Employee Directory

https://trentschneider.github.io/EmployeeDirectory/

## Description

This is a website demonstrating my abilities with ReactJS. The site is an employee directory that pulls the employee data, lists out all employees, has a filter feature that filters employees as you type, and allows for ascending or descending sorting by first or last name.

## Installation

There is no installation needed as this will work with any browser.

## Usage

This site allows the user to view an employee directory to find out basic employee information. To make searching the directory easier, the user can filter the employees by typing in the filter bar to filter down to the employee they need. The user can also sort the employees alphabetically in ascending or descending order by either their first name or their last name.
